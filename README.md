For the .svg interactivity to function, you must be running index.html on a server
Very simple if you have python 3 installed... just go to command line and type:
  python3 -m http.server 8080    (if you have python 2 and 3)
  python -m http.server 8080     (if python 3 is your default)

Then go to http://localhost:8080 in web browser

Also, added a style "cursor: pointer;" directly to text elements in the .svg file
